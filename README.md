# ai-deep-learning (and machine learning)

### Letter to Women's Coding Circel  

Hello everyone at Women's Coding Circle!  
Since we have been taking a machine learning class together during 2020-2021, I thought it will be nice to have a central repository for information on how to get started with AI,  deep learning, and machine learning.  In the past, I have posted many resources on Slack workspace, but they seem to get lost over time.  I sometimes see questions repeated by members that were answered before.

I will populate this repo with resources I have found useful in my leaning journey.  I hope others will follow and post resources they have found helpful.  Also, if you wrote a blog or articule related to AI and deep learning, please post links to them here to share with others at WCC. :-)
