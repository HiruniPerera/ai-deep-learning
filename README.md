# ai-deep-learning (and machine learning)

### A Letter to Women's Coding Circle
at https://www.janelia.org/, Janelia Research Campus  

Hello everyone at Women's Coding Circle!  
Since we have been taking a machine learning class together during 2020-2021, I thought it will be nice to have a central repository for information on how to get started with AI,  deep learning, and machine learning.  In the past, I have posted many resources on Slack workspace, but they seem to get lost over time.  I sometimes see questions repeated by members that were answered before.

I will populate this repo with resources I have found useful in my learning journey.  I hope others will take this up and post resources they have found helpful.  Also, if you wrote a blog or article related to AI and deep learning, please post links to them here to share with others at WCC. :-)  If you don't have access to the full repo and would like to add an article, please create a "pull-request."  I will add your post right away!
